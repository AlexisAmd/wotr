 * A magician can restore powers of an other NPC only one time. He can also give hps or corruption points (negative or positives ones) to frodo.
 * For example Gandalf is a good magician, he decreases the corruption of frodo while saruman (the evil one) increase these corruption points but they can both restor the powers of an other npc.
