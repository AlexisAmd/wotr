/**
* This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application.
* "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users
* can walk around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended
* to make it more interesting!
*
* To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
* method.
*
* This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
* rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
* executes the commands that the parser returns.
